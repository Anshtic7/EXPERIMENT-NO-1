# EXPERIMENT-NO-1

AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT:- 
To study and implement basic Python programming concepts such as variable assignment, data types, arithmetic operations, input–output functions, mathematical functions, and conditional statements using simple Python programs.

THEORY:- Python is a high-level, interpreted and user-friendly programming language widely used for general-purpose programming, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. In this experiment, basic Python programming concepts are studied through simple codes.

1. Variables and Data Types
A variable is a name used to store data in memory. Python does not require declaring the type of a variable explicitly. The type of a variable is decided automatically based on the value assigned.

Common data types used are:
int – for integer values
float – for decimal numbers
string – for text
bool – for True or False values

2. Input and Output Functions
Python provides built-in functions to interact with the user.
input() is used to take data from the user.
print() is used to display output on the screen.

4. Arithmetic Operations
Python supports various arithmetic operations such as:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (−)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Exponent (**).

5. Mathematical Functions
Python provides a math library that contains useful mathematical functions such as square root, power, logarithm, etc. These functions make complex calculations easy and accurate.

6. Conditional Statements
Conditional statements are used to make decisions in a program.
The if, elif, and else statements allow the program to execute different blocks of code depending on conditions.

Algorithm: 
{Addition of Two Numbers}

Start
Declare two variables a and b to store the input numbers.
Read the first number from the user using the input() function and store it in a.
Read the second number from the user using the input() function and store it in b.
Convert the input values to integer or float as required.
Add the two numbers using the + operator and store the result in sum.
Display the value of sum using the print() function.
Stop the program.

{Algorithm: Area of a Circle}

Start
Declare a variable r to store the radius of the circle.
Read the value of radius from the user using the input() function.
Convert the input value into float.
Declare a constant π (pi) as 3.14.
Calculate the area using the formula: pi*r^2
Store the result in a variable area.
Display the value of area using the print() function.
Stop the program.

{Algorithm: To Find the Greater of Two Numbers}

Start
Declare two variables a and b.
Read the first number from the user and store it in a.
Read the second number from the user and store it in b.
Compare the two numbers using the if condition.
If a > b, display "a is the greater number".
Else, display "b is the greater number".
Stop the program.

CONCUSION:- 
Through this experiment, basic Python programming concepts are understood. These concepts form the foundation for developing larger and more complex programs in Python.
